# Installation
## Dependencies
- Debian/Debian-based distros
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wmctrl xdotool
```
- Arch/Arch-based distros
```
sudo pacman -Sy
sudo pacman -S wmctrl xdotool
```
- RHEL/RHEL-based distros
```
sudo dnf upgrade
sudo dnf install wmctrl xdotool
```

### OBS websocket plugin
- Download this if and only if you plan on using wall.
- No need to download this if you are using OBS Studio > 28.0.0
- Binaries for OBS Studio < 28.0.0 on Debian/Debian-based distros are available in the [releases](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases) tab of the websocket repository.
- flatpak
```
flatpak install com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.WebSocket  
```
- Arch/Arch-based distros - Using [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)
```
yay -Sy
yay -S obs-websocket
```
- Note: The script was tested on 'obs-studio-tytan652' available on the AUR (Arch User Repositories).
- Any bugs on other versions can be posted in the [Issues](https://github.com/sathya-pramodh/MultiInstanceLinux/issues) tab.

### Install the package from pip
- Install the package distributed through pip.
- Use sudo to install the package as pip by default installs packages in `.local/` directory which is usually not in PATH for many distros.
- By using sudo, it installs the package in `/usr/` which is in PATH by default.
```
sudo pip install MultiInstanceLinux
```

# Usage
- This command must be executed in a terminal each time you want to use the macro. You could set it up so that the script runs each time you start up all the instances of Minecraft.
- It must be executed with sudo because the keyboard module requires elevated privileges to run on Linux.
```
sudo multiinstancelinux
```

## Some important instructions
- This macro also assumes that you are using Atum and FastReset mods for Minecraft 1.16.1. It is hardcoded assuming so.
- Use all your instances in 'windowed' mode as using it in fullscreen minimizes the Minecraft window as you switch to OBS while using wall.
- If you do not want to use wall resetting, make sure to set the same keybinds as the macro to switch instances and to switch scenes. For example, in the default config, one would have to set `Ctrl+1` to switch to the instance named "Instance 1" in OBS.
- Log files are located in the 'log' directory in the project script's main folder. So, issues must be submitted with the relevant log files attached to them.
- The 'testing' branch is meant only for testing purposes and releases from that branch are created with the '-testing' tag at the end of them.

# Contribution
- Code contributions can be made to the testing branch. Pull requests must be made with proper comments and documentation.
- The code must follow all PEP8 conventions and must be in python3.x ONLY.

# Default Keybinds
- `Ctrl+R` - Reset all instances (RSG)
- `Shift+R` - Reset the current instance (RSG)
- `Ctrl+S` - Suspend all instances other than the active one.
- `Alt+S` - Unsuspend all instances.
- `Ctrl+o` - Switch to the wall scene on OBS (Only while using wall).
- `Ctrl+1` - Switch to Instance 1
- `Ctrl+2` - Switch to Instance 2
- `Ctrl+3` - Switch to Instance 3
- `Ctrl+4` - Switch to Instance 4
- `Ctrl+5` - Switch to Instance 5
- `Ctrl+6` - Switch to Instance 6
- `Ctrl+7` - Switch to Instance 7
- `Ctrl+8` - Switch to Instance 8
- `Ctrl+9` - Switch to Instance 9
- `Shift+1` - Switch to Instance 1 and reset all others.
- `Shift+2` - Switch to Instance 2 and reset all others.
- `Shift+3` - Switch to Instance 3 and reset all others.
- `Shift+4` - Switch to Instance 4 and reset all others.
- `Shift+5` - Switch to Instance 5 and reset all others.
- `Shift+6` - Switch to Instance 6 and reset all others.
- `Shift+7` - Switch to Instance 7 and reset all others.

# Configuration
- All configurations can be done in config.py which is located in the .config/MultiInstanceLinux/ directory of your home folder.
- A default config is provided and the script will rollback to it if it doesn't find the file in the working directory.
- A new config.py will be created from the default config if a config.py doesn't exist already.
